1.  Four preliminary points
2.  Utilitarianism
3.  Deontology
4.  Virtue Ethics
5.  Social contract theory


### First point
> Moral theory is the attempt to provide general guidelines for moral action. It specifies which actions are permissible and which are impermissible. We are thus at the level of **normative ethics** here


### Second point
> If any moral theory applies at all it does so transculturally. That is, we can do moral theory only if **ethical relativism is false**
-   A true moral theory, applies transculturally


### Third point
> An action is permissible only if it...
-   Produces the best consequences (utilitarianism)
-   Is motivated by the right reasons (deontology)
-   Is motivated by the proper character traits (virtue ethics)
-   Is sanctioned by an agreement among rational agents (social contract theory)
  

### Fourth point
> Most of the conflicts about how to understand what it means to act in an environmentally sustainable way can be traced back to one or another of these theoretical positions




## Utilitarianism: Jerry Bentham

### Definition
-   A permissible action is one that wil lead to the greatest balajnce of pleasure over pain among all sentient beings whose interests will be affecetd by a proposed course of action
-   Proposed that pleasures and pains can be quantified
-   "The greatest happiness for the greatest number", which action leads to the best outcome
-   Consequentialist theory

### Key Claim
-   Human beings are no longer superior to other beings as long as they are able to feel pleasure and pain
-   Equal moral standing e.g. humans and dogs




## Deontology
Ethical theory that uses rules to distinguish right from wrong

-   Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

### The categorical imperative (I)
> Act only according to those rules that anybody in similar circumstancrs could act by. Don't make an exception of yourself

-   His example was lying, thought that one should not lie under any circumstance
-   Lying is problematic because if everyone acted that way, the entire truth system would collapse
-   Axe murderer example

### The categorical imperative (II)
> Treat other people as **'ends** in themselves,' rather than as mere **means** to the fulfillment of your ends or desires

-   Don't 'use' people
-   Used heavily in rights discussions

### The Key to both forms
> **Intentions,** not **consequences** are what matter morally

-   Kant thinks that the consequences have nothing to do with you. e.g. telling axe murderer where the soon-to-be victim is




## Virtue Ethics
Aristotle: 384BCE-322BCE
-   About character traits
  
### Key
> The life of reason is the life of **virtue**. What is a virtue? A state of character that causes us to act in specific ways on specific occasions.

-   Ex. courage, liberality, modesty, kindness, pride, justice
    -   So for example, the courageous person will do what courage demands in situations that call for it. e.g. battle

### Doctrine of the mean - definition:
> Every virtue is a middle point between two morally impermissible states (the extremes)

-   Vice vs. Virtue

## Social contract theory

### Hobbes' claims
Civil society emerges out of the state of nature
-   In an original state of nature, there was no government, no binding rules, everyone for themselves
-   Civil society emerged out of this anarchical society
-   State of nature is a 'war of all against all'. Life there is 'nasty, poor, brutish and short.'
-   To escape this state, people **'sign a contract'** to hand over their right to attack others to an all-powerful authority (The Leviathan)
-   Condition for signing the contract is that everybody else does as well
-   Why do we sign? Just to avoid being victimized by our neighbours
-   **Key:** the authority **invents** right and wrong, just and unjust


## Key idea
An action is permissible if it is the product of an **agreement** among rational agents. If it is nt, it is impermissible
