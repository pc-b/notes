1.  Rights for living things
2.  What is life
3.  Biocentric egalitarianism

## <center>1.  Rights for living things
### What is a 'holder of legal rights'?
>
- The thing can institute legal action at its behest **(voice)**
- The thing can be injured **(injury)**
- Legal relief must be aimed at benefitting the thing **(compensation)**

### Voice: Proxies
> We already have a notion of a legal proxy in the case of 'incompetents,' so why not extend it to natural objects?
- Is deforestation not injury?

### Compensation
> If a thing can be injured then there should be some way to compensate it for the damage done to it

### Non-psychocentrism
> Biocentrism claims that entities **lacking psychological states** can still have interests

---

## <center>2. What is life?
### Moderns vs. pre-moderns
>
-   **Modern view**: things canot go well or badly for anything but humans
-   **Pre-modern view**: everything in nature can be undertood teleologically (as goal directed). Therefore things can go well or badly for such things

### Entropy at work
>
-   Hot coffee at time 
-   Hot coffee at time 2
-   Life is about establishing events at order? idk i got distracted

### What living things do
>
-   Incorporate outside energy
-   Use it to build biomass (grow0 and maintain subsystems that help the organism resist external threats)

### Example: immune system
>
-   Helps the body resist pathogens, tumors etc,  which would otherwise break the body down.
    -   **Key**: every living thing has something like this while no non-living thing has anything like it



## Conclusion
>
-   Things can go well or badly for a living body
-   So Aristotle is correct, the modern view incorrect

### Holders of legal rights (again)
>
-   Living things can be injured in a non-derivative sense **(injury)**
-   So we can specify the way to bnefit them **(compensation)**
-   And, they can 'tell us' when they are injured so that we can defend their interests **(voice)**

## 3. Biocentric egalitarianism 
### Four theses
>
-   Humans are "members of Earth's community of life." We need the biosphere much more than **it** needs us
-   The biophere is a complex web of causally interdependent **systems**
-   Each living things is a 'teleological centre'

### Three points
>
-   The language ("crimes against nature", etc) evokes **rights-discourse**
-   Clear-cutting attacks the foundation of life in a forest: the soil
-   Humans are seen as part of the system but a part only

### Thesis four
>
-   Humans are not superior to other living things

### Supeririotry claim: first source
>
-   **Greek rationalism**: We're superior in virtue of our capacity to reason

### Superiority claim: second source
>
-   **Cartesian dualism**: we have souls, nothing else does

### The problem
>
-   Reason and soul-possession are value-neutral properties
