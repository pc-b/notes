1.  Rights for living things
2.  What is life
3.  Biocentric egalitarianism

## 1.  Rights for living things
### What is a 'holder of legal rights'?
>
- The thing can institute legal action at its behest **(voice)**
- The thing can be injured **(injury)**
- Legal relief must be aimed at benefitting the thing **(compensation)**

### Voice: Proxies
> We already have a notion of a legal proxy in the case of 'incompetents,' so why not extend it to natural objects?
- Is deforestation not injury?

### Compensation
> If a thing can be injured then there should be some way to compensate it for the damage done to it

### Non-psychocentrism
> Biocentrism claims that entities **lacking psychological states** can still have interests
