## Introduction<center>
One of the most important things we need to do when we argue for a claim or view is to ensure that we are not misunderstood. If I want to convince you of the truth of a proposition p, then I had better make sure you understand p the way I intend p to be understood. On the other hand, words come preloaded with meanings. The same action may be described as freedom fighting or terrorism, depending on whether you think the action good or bad. And if I am trying to win you to my side about an issue you know nothing about using ‘freedom fighter’ or ‘terrorist’ will make a difference. If you value my judgement you may come to view a person positively or negatively. Of course, if we are not careful, the language rather than the argument may manipulate us

## Use-Mention Distinction<center>
### ***To use a word is to assert it; to use a proposition is to assert whatever is claimed in the proposition"

Using a word:
    -   When you use a word, you are making an assertion
    -   Ex. "cat" you are asserting or stating the concept of a cat
Using a proposition:
    -   When you use a proposition, you are asserting whatever is claimed or stated in that proposition
    -   Ex. "The sky is blue" using this proposition involves asserting that the sky, is in fact, blue

## Persuasive Language<center>
Persuasive language does not actually make an argument stronger, it only seems to.

### Emotionally charged language
Involves the use of words with additional emotional force to influence the reader or listener's emotions.


>Example: John Smith is guilty of the senseless slaughter of innocent children. He is a butcher who preys on the helpless.

>Here the words ‘senseless, slaughter’, ‘innocent’, ‘butcher’, ‘preys’, and ‘helpless’ all function as emotionally charged language, casting John Smith in an extremely negative light.

>Emotionally charged language need not always elicit negative feelings. It can also work by producing positive or sympathetic feelings in the listener.

>Example: Mr. Jones, a fine, upstanding citizen, with ties to the community, and father of three, is just the innocent victim of circumstance. He represents a low flight-risk.

>Here the phrases ‘fine, upstanding citizen’, ‘innocent victim’, ‘father of three’, and ‘ties to the community’ are introduced to elicit sympathy for him.

>Govier provides a variation of emotionally charged language that substitutes an abusive word or phrase for an argument. For instance, instead of claiming that you need to rethink your position I might simply assert that you are being stubborn, ignorant, foolish, deplorable, gullible, etc.

>Example: “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.” —Hillary Clinton, September 9, 2016

>Instead of arguing that Donald Trump’s policies were dangerous or inadequate, Clinton claimed his supporters, and therefore Trump himself, were deplorable.

### Euphemisms
A way to substitute a word for another. A mild word or phrase is substituted for one that is considered less offensive.

Ex. "Operational statement" as a replacement for "lie"

## Ambiguity<center>
A word, phrase or sentence is ambiguous when it has more than one meaning. All meanings are clear, but from the context we don't know which one we should use.

### Semantic ambiguity: ***results when a single word can be taken to have more than one plausible meaning in a single context

Ex. bank
This can refer to an institution that deals with money, the edge of a river, or a shot in pool

Usually the context can clear up the true meanining of the ambiguous word but sometimes it is unclear.

Ex. I'm afraid there are bugs in my room
This could either mean there are insects, or listening devices in the speaker's room.

### Syntactic Ambiguity ***occurs when an entire sentence can be taken to have several meanings as a result of the grammatical structure of the sentence.
Also referred to as amphiboly.

Ex. Noted UFO Fanatic Peter Smith will talk to us tonight about sexual experiences with aliens in the student center.

>This can mean either:

>Peter Smith will talk to us tonight about sexual experiences people have had with aliens, and that these experiences took place in the student centre.

>Or

>Peter Smith will talk to us tonight in the student center about sexual experiences people have had with aliens.

When a speaker can slide between two or more meanings of a word in an argument without realizing it, it is referred to as a fallacy of equivocation.

## Fallacy of equivocation<center>
A fallacy is a error of reasoning. In arguments a fallacy is a common mistake in reasoning, often that goes unnoticed.

---

## Vagueness<center>
Vagueness is similar to ambiguity since both are a problem with clarity of meaning. When a word, phrase or sentence is vague, it has no definite meaning at all.

Ex. sick, bald, good, are all vague terms

### Useless modifiers
> ### Very, so much, a lot, kind of, sort of

### Relative terms
> ### Big, small, tall, short, fast, slow

When arguments employ vague terms, phrases, or sentences, they are bad arguments. If a premise is vague, it has no definite meaning.

When making arguments you must be specific, and avoid being vague. If a premise has no definite meaning, then it cannot be true or false, and cannot support any particular conclusion

---

## Definiitions<center>

### Ostensive definitions
> Require us to point to or indicate something in order to convey the meaning of the word that names it. The word ostension just means to show or to exhibit
>
> Ex. learning something in a new language. We begin by pointing to objects and asking "what is this called"

### Reportive or Lexical definition
> A dictionary definition. Describes the way a word is ordinarily understood and used

### Denotion of a word***is the lexical definition--what the word denotes or refers to***

### Connotation of a word ***is what sense the word has for us, the associations a word evokes in different contexts

### Stipulative definition
> Establishes new meaning of a word for a particular purpose. Usually involves modifying the established lexical meaning of a term in some way. Can be slight, or involve significant changes in meaning.

### Persuasive definitions
> Another kind of stipulative definition. Disguised stipulative definitions used in arguments as premises.
>
> Good way of identifying them is looking for indicator words:
>   -   Authentic, genuine, real, true
>
> Ex. 
>   -   A real man can drink at least 16 beers before they get drunk
>   -   A true Canadian plays hockey

### Operational definitions
> A word is defined in terms of when a specified operation yields a specified result
>
> Example: (From the Government of Canada website) Throughout Canada, the maximum legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for fully licensed drivers is to be under 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, or 0.08. Driving with a BAC of 0.08 or over is a criminal offence and the penalties are severe.
>
>‘Drunkenness’ is a relatively imprecise term. We might say someone is drunk when he or she slurs their words, or when they fall down and pass out. Obviously, if you are to be charged with drunk driving, the police cannot rely on such an unclear definition of drunkenness. They use a legal definition that is an operational definition.
>
>The legal definition of drunkenness is an operational definition. It defines drunkenness in terms of blood-alcohol content (BAC). There is a procedure that we have to go through that involves testing blood for BAC. The operation or procedure involves the use of a breathalyser. When the breathalyser indicates a particular result, you are drunk.

## Conclusion<center>
Language plays an important role in what we come to believe. Ideally, good arguments convince us of their conclusions, even when those conclusions are surprising. All of us hold beliefs that we have not tested, things we learned as children, and later while not being critically attentive. I may be prepared to change my mind about a belief I have not thought much about and which is not central to my worldview. But I ought to be prepared to give up on even central beliefs in the presence of convincing arguments.

Critical in testing my beliefs, though, is distinguishing good arguments from bad, rational arguments from flawed ones that play on my emotions or manipulate language to try to persuade me. This lesson has been about how to decide if language is playing an inappropriate role in the power of an argument; and conversely how to avoid language that weakens our own arguments. In the next lesson we will start to develop some tools for evaluating arguments based on their structure and content, rather than on the way they are presented.
