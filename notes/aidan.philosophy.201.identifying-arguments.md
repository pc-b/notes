##  <center>Introduction
-   Definition of an argument
---

##  <center>What is an argument?
### Argument:
>
### <center>An attempt to justify or prove a point through rational means.
---

##  <center>Components of an argument
### Conclusion
-   What the argument is trying to get you to accept.

### Premise
-   Reasons used to support the conclusion

### Indicator words
-   **Conclusions**:
    -       thus, therefore, hence, so, it follows that, shows that, indicates that, proves that, then
-   **Premises**:
    -       for, since, because, for the reason that, on the grounds that, follows from

##  <center>Explanations
### Arguments:
-   try to convince you of a conclusion or give you reasons to believe something is true.


### Explanations
-   tell you why something is true or is the way it is but give you no reasons to believe it is true.

### Argument or Explanation?

    <summary>When you have the hiccups your diaphragm is not properly synchronized to your breathing. So, holding your breath or deep breathing exercises can stop them.
    </summary>
    <p> Explanation. "So" doesn't indicate an argument. Speaker is not trying to convice you the truth of anything

        I don't want to go to the dance. If we go, then I will be the laughing stock of the school. Because my parents made me learn nothing but tap-dancing as a child, I can't even do the Floss.
    </summary>
    <p> Explanation. Speaker is explaining why they don't want to go. "Because" doesn't indicate a premise here

        Whenever Sparky needs to go out, he taps you with his paw. Since Sparky is tapping you with his paw, he must need to go out.
    </summary>
    <p> Argument. The aim is not to explain Sparky’s behaviour, but to get the listener to accept the truth of the claim “Sparky needs to go out.” In this case, since indicates a premise.

        City Councils often think suburbs are a good idea. Councillors get lured into approving the developments with thoughts of more tax dollars. Given that suburbs are spread out and sparsely populated, compared to urban development, they require extensive roads that are costly to build and maintain. Also, despite the car dependency of suburbs, they still need to be serviced by public transport, which is much more expensive to operate over large, more sparsely populated areas. Hence, suburbs are a bad idea.
    </summary> Argument. "Given that" and "hence" are indicator words

        It is clear that game agencies ought to stop spending time and money on wolf-control programs, which consist of shooting or poisoning wolves at random. Between 2005 and 2018, Alberta killed 225 wolves with strychnine in addition to deaths from aerial gunning. Yet the number of cattle killed each year by wolves is fewer than 25. By contrast, in 2019 almost 800 cows were dead on arrival at slaughterhouses and another 7,500 were condemned (as unfit for human consumption). This results from bad farming and trucking practices.

### Identify the main point of the passage
‎ | More Certain | Less Certain

Arguments | The Other Points | The Main Point
Explanations | The Main Point | The Other Points

### Use principal of clarity
-   If it is a weak argument, treat it as such...

##  <center>Descriptions
-   ### Statement; fact
        Forty-nine divided by seven equals seven.
-   ### Emotional outburst
        I can’t stand broccoli!
-   ### Question
        What are the causes of juvenile delinquency?
-   ### Description
        It was a crisp and frosty September morning, but so many problems occupied their minds that the beauty of the day went unappreciated.

>### Descriptions are neither arguments or explanations. They are a list of facts. They offer you new information but provide no reason for truth and no reason to believe they are true. Purely used for providing information.

### Description, Argument, or Explanation?

<details>
    <summary>
        The last person he asked out on a date laughed at him, hence John is afraid to ask anyone out.
    </summary>
    <p>This explains John's fear of asking people out on dates. It is therefore an explanation and not an argument.

        Ever since I was a little boy I have been afraid of clowns. I guess it all stems from the time my dad took me to the circus and was run over by that little car the clowns drive around the ring.

    <summary>
        Pandas are frequently thought to be a species of bear, like grizzlies and polar bears, but they are not actually bears at all.
    </summary>
    <p>This is a description. The speaker does not try to convince us that people have mistaken views about pandas, but simply describes the fact that many people do have mistaken beliefs about these animals.

        Factory farming is a major source of pollution. It concentrates large quantities of manure that would, in traditional methods of farming, be naturally returned to the fields. As a result of this concentration, water in rivers, lakes, and the ground is contaminated by nitrates. This concentration of manure also means that it decomposes without oxygen, unlike manure that falls in the fields, thereby producing methane.
    </summary>
    <p>This is an argument. The speaker is trying to convince us that factory farming is a major source of pollution. They do this by claiming that factory farming results in large concentrations of manure that, in turn, contaminate water and produce methane.

        Diplomacy is a better option than military action in cases of conflict. Modern war virtually guarantees that civilians will suffer. Even in a limited military conflict, drones and cruise missiles may avoid the deaths of countless innocent people, but end up destroying resources they need for a decent life. Consider Syria where a civil war using far less sophisticated weapons has decimated hospitals, health centres, water purification systems, and power supplies.
    </summary>
    <p>This is an argument. The speaker is trying to convince us that diplomacy is the better option, but pointing out the negative effects of even the ‘best’ military options.

##  <center>Propositions

>### A proposition is a statement or assertion. One of the defining features of a proposition is that any proposition must be either true or false. As we saw in section 1.4, there are many ways that we use language. Of all the ways we use language only propositions are true or false.

### Simple proposition
-   Single complete thought
-   eg. John is tall

### Compound proposition
-   Expresses more than one thought
-   eg. I love you and you love me

### Disjunction
-   A proposition that joins two statements by 'or' is a disjunction
-   eg. “I can afford to go to the movies or I can afford to go for dinner.”

### Conditional claims
-   “If Arctic ice melts, (then) ocean levels around the world will be higher.”
-   If/then statement

##  <center>Conclusion
So far we have considered the different uses of language with the aim of being able to differentiate arguments from the other forms of language. To help identify arguments we have considered indicator words and strategies for thinking about the intent of the speaker. The aim of the course is argumentation. Our goal will always be on building strong arguments and recognizing weak ones. The first quiz and mock quiz (week 2) focus on being able to identify arguments, explanations, and descriptions. What we have learned in this lesson is intended to help us do just that.

In the next lesson we will focus exclusively on the structure of arguments—how premises come to support a conclusion, and when they might fail to do so, when a conclusion is used to support a further conclusion, and how to identify and construct premises and conclusions that might be missing from arguments.
