### "Wanton cruelty such that is involved in the torture of children, is wrong"

## Expressive meaning

-   Gives vent to emotion; i.e. "ugh!"

## Imperatival meaning

-   Used to command; i.e. "shut the door!"

## According to skeptics

-   Our sentence does not mean there is something in the world, torture that is objectively bad. i.e. the statement is not true or false
 
## So it can only mean..

-   "Torture! Ugh! It's gross!" (expressive meaning)

-   "I hate torture. You should too." (imperatival meaning)

-   In both cases the sentence is neither true nor false, but it is not nonsense because it has emotive meaning

## Key point:

-   Ethical relativism is often mistaken for skepticism, but the two ideas are importantly distinct

# What is ethical relativism?

-   Definition: The moral rightness and wrongness of actions varies across societies and there are thus no absolute moral standards binding on all people at all times. Recognizing this, we should be tolerant of moral differences across societies

## Why this is not moral skepticism:

-   Moral sentences can be true or false. They are true if they describe how a particular group think about a particular issue. They are false if they mis-describe this

## Ethical relativism: the argument

-   Premise 1: Diversity Thesis

-   Premise 2: Dependency Thesis

-   Premise 3: No Transcultural Codes

-   Conclusion: Tolerance Thesis

## Premise 1: The diversity thesis

-   A descriptive claim to the effect that there are numerous cultures in the world, each of which has a distinct moral code; an "is" statement about how the world actually is

## Premise 2: Dependency thesis

-   A culture's moral code merges out of the particular values and social arrangement of that culture itself

## Premise 3: No transcultural codes

-    There are no moral principles binding on all persons, regardless of the culture they inhabit. This is because no single code transcends and particular culture

-    Binding: "you ought not to", the moral claim applies to you whether you like it or not

## Conclusion: The tolerance thesis

-    It follows from premises 1-3 that we must not stand in judgement of the moral codes or practices of other cultures. We must be tolerant of moral difference

# Four Criticisms of Ethical Relativism:

## Deriving an 'ought' from an 'is':

-    From claims only about the way the world **is**, nothing follows about the way it **should be**.

### Example: "We eat a lot of meat"

-    *Question*: What follows logically from this sentence?

1.  "We ought not to do this"

2.  "We ought to keep on doing this"

3.  Neither (1) or (2)

-    *Answer*: (3) Nothing **normative** follows logically from the purely **descriptive** claim about our diet

###  

### Introduce a normative premise:

-   We eat a lot of meat

-   [Doing so is morally objectionable]{.underline}

-   Therefore we should eat less meat, or none at all

## Overstating diversity:

### Examples:

-   Every society makes a distinction between justified and unjustified killing.

-   Every society places some restrictions on sexual activities. Most place a taboo on incest

-   Every society considers lying wrong under specially defined circumstances

## Tolerance thesis

-   Tolerance thesis looks like a **transcultural moral principle**, contrary to premise 3 of the argument

## Rational Criticism:
-   No possibility of rational criticism. 

### Example:

-    What can we say to the Hitlers of the world if ethical relativism is true? We cannot say they are evil or wrong. Maybe all we can say is "Hitler, BOO!". Is that enough?
